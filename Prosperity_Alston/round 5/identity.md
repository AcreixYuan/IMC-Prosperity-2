10. CharlieChimpanzee

    Always looking for momentum to jump in on a fair trade. Because, well… he just loves jumping. And bananas. Jumping and bananas, yes. Those are the two things that make Charlie happy.

11. PabloProboscis

    Thinks he has a real nose for profitable trading opportunities. Pretty dominant and sly. Keeps confronting others with the ultimatum “plata o plomo”. Nobody knows what he means by that. Or takes him seriously, for that matter.

12. OliviaOrangutan

    Likes to dream big. Sometimes it's almost as if she knows what the future holds. At other times, she's just like the rest of the group; laid back and lazy.

13. OrsonOrangutan

    Abides by a very strict trading protocol: never trade on an empty stomach. Also suffers from periods of insatiable hunger. Making him the most whimsical monkey in the history of trading monkeys.

    Working remote out of the jungle. Has big ambitions. Has big fingers too, making it hard to push the right buttons on his smartphone.

16. MyaMacaque

    Mya is regarded as the mother of the pack. Overseeing the bigger picture. Lovable, but also fairly slow and indecisive. Rumor has it she's named after a 20th century pop idol. But that's just gorilla gossip.

17. MaxMacaque

    Grunts alot while working the numbers. If he's not spending time trading, he's grooming his crest. This ambitious monkey loves a tough nut to crack. But he likes fruit as well.
