# IMC Prosperity 2

This is our repo for the Participation in IMC Prosperity Round 2.

All the research and the code associated with it is in the corresponding Repos.

Eventually we ranked 368th and were 104th in the US.

The topics of each round where the following:

* Round 1: There were 2 differen assets to trade. One of them was momentum based, the other one was mean reverting. We implemented a mean reverting trading strategy and a momentum strategy.
* Round 2: Another asset got included, which was based on certain external factors.
* Round 3: This round incldued a basic ETF arbitrage algorithm, where both the basket and the underlyings could be traded. We  were able to identify some basic arbitrages here.
* Round 4: This round was about an Option Pricing Algo component, where Black-Scholes was implemented to price options and find arbitrages between the underlying and the associated Option
* Round 5: This round was about finding signals of submitted trades between people and finding if there are causalities that people can find. Unfortunately, we were running out of time and didn't investigate any signals on that and submitted Round 4 algo.
